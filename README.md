I build end-to-end systems — from backend and infrastructure to AI agents in production.

I don't chase tools or hype. I focus on **fundamentals**, **scale**, and **shipping systems** that survive real-world constraints.

## What I'm Building

Right now, I'm deep in the AI space — not the slide-deck version, but the version that needs to work at 3 AM under load.

- **Agentic systems** — orchestration, tool use, multi-agent architectures
- **LLMs in production** — cost, latency, observability, reliability
- **Infra-aware AI** — because models without systems thinking is just expensive experimentation
- **Human-in-the-loop design** — AI that amplifies, not replaces

*AI with heart* — but backed by engineering discipline.

## Languages & Tech

**Languages don't matter as much anymore** — the lines are blurring. That said, I'm comfortable with:

`Python` · `Go` · `Rust` · `TypeScript`

**Infrastructure & Platform**
- Kubernetes, Docker, Helm
- AWS (EKS, RDS, IAM, networking)
- Observability, CI/CD, GitOps

**Architecture**
- Distributed systems, microservices
- Event-driven design, async systems
- gRPC, REST, messaging (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

*(Tools change. Principles don't.)*

## Philosophy

```
Skills > Titles
Shipping > Slides
Systems > Snippets
```

- If you can't debug it, you don't understand it
- AI doesn't replace thinking — it amplifies it
- The best code is code you can reason about at 2 AM

I learn by building, breaking, fixing, and repeating.

## What You'll Find Here

- Experiments with AI agents & orchestration
- Infrastructure-heavy projects
- Proofs of concept exploring *"does this actually work?"*

Not everything here is polished — but everything here is intentional.
